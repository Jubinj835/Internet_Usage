# Internet_Usage
Analyze Internet Use with Python


In this project, I analyzed data on internet usage from Our World in Data (via the World Bank and International Telecommunications Union).

I wrote custom methods to answer questions like:

how long does it take for internet to reach the majority of people in different countries, regions, and income brackets?
how much does internet usage accelerate over the years?
how did the growth of the internet compare across the 2000s and 2010s?
